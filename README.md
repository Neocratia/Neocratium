Neocratium enables communities of all sizes — even non-political ones — to debate and make democratic decisions.

When ready, groups will be able to use our hosted version, or download our free, open source code and install their own.

Neocratium is a platform developed by [Neocratia](https://neocratia.org). Neocratia's goal is to upgrade the way our laws are created.
